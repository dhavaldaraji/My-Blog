# My-Blog
My First and Simple Blog Project in Python Django Framework  

In this Blog I use Postgres Database. 
And I learn from youtube channel name "corey schafer".

<h2> What I learn in this project ?</h2>

- I learn migration in python. It is useful to migrate our model object into the database.
- I learn how to use user django pre-define userform in to user registration.
-I also learn python MVT(Model-View-Templete) concept.
  - In MVT concept,
        The Template is a presentation layer which handles User Interface part completely(Like... HTML,CSS,JS etc). 
        The View is used to execute the business logic and interact with a model to carry data and renders a template.
